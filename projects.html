    <h3>Circuit Debater</h3>
    <p>I developed the suite of Circuit Debater websites while in high school to help make high school debate more equitable. Top debaters often pay for expensive coaches to achieve competitive success, which is inaccessible for many. Circuit Debater is a platform for debaters to post examples of their cases, arguments, and readings as a free resource for debaters. The site has served thousands of debaters in its lifespan, aggregating hundreds of thousands of views. See <a href="https://ld.circuitdebater.org">Circuit Debater LD</a>, <a href="https://pf.circuitdebater.org">Circuit Debater PF</a>, <a href="https://tools.circuitdebater.org">Circuit Debater Tools</a>, and the <a href="https://ld.circuitdebater.org/w/index.php/Library">Circuit Debater Library</a>.</p>

    <h3>Coding Tutorials</h3>
    <p>I developed <a href="https://codingtutorials.org">codingtutorials.org</a> while in elementary and middle school to help teach fellow students how to use the <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a> programming language. The project was largely motivated by a desire to teach others how to code upon realizing many lacked adequate resources to help them get started. Later on, I added resources to the website to give suggestions on how to teach coding from the student's perspective.</p>
